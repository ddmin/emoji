# Em🙃ji (and ⋃𝔑ⅈç◯ⅆε⁡)

Displays a `rofi` menu with emojis and loads the emoji into clipboard.

***Update***: now it automatically pastes the emoji

Mapped to mod+E on my keyboard.

Unicode Selector is mapped to mod+W.

`bash -e $HOME/Code/Bash/emoji-selector`
`bash -e $HOME/Code/Bash/unicode-selector`

## Files
* emoji-list and unicode-list goes in ~/.config/rofi/emoji-list
* emoji-selector and unicode-list just needs to be on $PATH

## Original Script
The rofi script was 99% copied from this [script](https://gist.github.com/imAliAzhar/f3b16622cd279fb0b019f237a8a12510).

The script to get emojis and unicode was written by me.

## Changes
I don't use the theme attached to this gist because [my theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddmin/dotfiles/master/dotfiles/.Xresources) will suffice.
